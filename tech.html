        Non-stick, ultra repellent self-healing, surface coatings for industrial
        and medical materials. <br /><br />
        Inspired by the Nepenthes pitcher plant, provides unique capabilities
        that are unmatched by any other liquid repellent surface
        technologies.<br /><br />
        This inexpensive super repellent surface has grabbed the sectors ranging
        from refrigeration & architecture to consumer products. The repellent
        surfaces designed is based after lotus leaves which are extremely
        hydrophobic due to their rough, wary surface, has no far met the mark:
        they may repel water but fail to repel oils and others.<br /><br />
        SLIPS technology inspired by the slippery pitcher plant can be applied
        to wider range of materials including plastics, metals, ceramics, glass
        and even concrete. They repel all kind of liquids and products: oil,
        paint, emulsions, lotions and gels, as well as blood, bacteria and
        marine organisms.<br /><br />
        The versatility of SLIPS, their robustness and unique ability to
        selfheal makes it possible to design these surfaces for use almost
        anywhere, even under extreme temperature and pressure conditions.

        <h4>Let us learn from the world’s richest man</h4>

        <i class=""
          >“I believe you have to be willing to be misunderstood if you are
          going to innovate”- Jeff Bezos, AMAZON</i
        ><br /><br />
        Luckily, we all want to grow in terms of beauty …luxury …so on.<br /><br />
        But up to what sincerity we are working to achieve them?<br /><br />
        Jeff Bezos-one of the worlds richest persons and an inspiration for
        millions of entrepreneurs around the world. A journey that began with an
        online bookstore and cumulated into a global ecommerce giant has many
        lessons under its wrap which professionals from different fields are
        trying hard to emulate.<br /><br />
        However, the best lessons we can learn from his failure not from the
        success of his brainchild amazon. Some of the biggest gaffes included
        the fire phone, register-credit card processing service for the certain
        bets which paid him rich dividends such as the kindle e-reader, and so
        he justified his choice and risk-taking approach as,<i class="">
          “Bold bets pay for a lot of failures. I’ve made billions of dollars of
          failures at Amazon.com. we can’t be in survival mode. We have to be in
          growth mode.”</i
        ><br /><br />
        <i class=""
          >“if you are doing anything interesting in the world. you are going to
          have critics. You can’t stop it. move forward. it’s not worth losing
          any sleep over. When you receive criticism from the well-meaning
          people, it pays you to ask, ‘are they right? and if they are, you need
          to adapt what they’re doing. If they are not right, if you really have
          the conviction that they’re not right, you need to have that long-term
          willingness to be misunderstood. It’s a key part of innovation>” -
          Jeff Bezos</i
        ><br /><br />
        When you are going to do something-out of the box ,you are going have
        almost as many critics and haters as followers and admirers. Even the
        most successful people from any fields own them out in each step of
        their journey. But what sets them apart from commoners is their way of
        handling their critics and admirers at the same time. The bigger you aim
        the more ruckuses your critics would try to create to distract you.
        There is no possible way to escape criticism and the only way out it is
        by accepting them and taking the in your stride.<br /><br />
        Humble origins and simplistic approach will win up a big smile for you.
        For a big in life focus on simple things and do them religiously and you
        would see the result sooner or later. There is always a win in
        discovering yourself – I…ME…MYSELF.

        <h4>Creating identity & Responsibility</h4>
        <img src="img/gallery/identity.jpg" alt="" class="responsive-img" />
        In this great life, in the grand scheme of things, I still have little
        to nothing to figure out. <br />
        I stumbled, that made me fall but I learned how to get up. Living well,
        doing good & making life better, this is what we all need.<br />
        If you want to change your life, then change your identity. Identity is
        what determines the actions you perform. Have you ever received a gift
        on birthdays?<br />
        If yes… Did you receive what you wished for?<br />
        If yes… it’s like OMG… OWW!!!<br />
        If not… then of course you took a deep breath and said it’s okay. I can
        use it some way or the other.<br />
        Same goes for life. What you hope are in your thoughts. The limitations
        in your life are framed by the box of your mind. The type of person you
        believe that you are and the type of things that you believe you are
        capable of and the actions you perform determines your identity.<br />
        The gift that you wish - a thought that just popped out of your mind
        should be resulting in action in order to get what you have wished
        for.<br />
        If you want a new life, then start building a new you - a new
        identity.<br />
        Start small. Prove yourself in a thousand tiny ways - so as to get that
        desired gift. Soon it will become real in thousand big ways.<br />
        A lot of you must be thinking,
        <i class="">“If I just work hard, then things will work out for me.”</i
        ><br />
        May be. May be not.<br />
        It’s your job to decide the direction for your life. Of course you want
        some by your side to help you out in this. The world is filled with good
        people who want good things for you. But they are busy with their own
        lives. It’s not their job to find opportunities for you. They won’t help
        you unless you can tap them on the shoulder and say,<i class=""
          >“I’d like to get there. Do you know how?”</i
        ><br />
        A purpose is everything. Hope is everything. Will and determination join
        hands in them. If you know where you want to go in life, then people
        will either help you to get there or get out of the way.<br />
        Both of those are useful.<br />
        Start now. Have a smile. Create your identity.<br />
