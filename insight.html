        ><br /><br />
        Examples, Biographies, Stories etc…. we all need motivation to work on
        something. We all want to become like our idols. Possessing their ideas,
        thought, good deeds.<br /><br />
        Why not become the 1st you?<br /><br />
        <b>THE YOU!!!</b><br /><br />
        Do not wait for motivation. If you have goal, the most important thing
        is to start. If it’s not there, it will come once you give it a
        start.<br /><br />
        Then comes the “Excuses”.<br /><br />
        I have no money, no good factor, etc. But it not only happens with you.
        Most of us begin at the same place: no money, no resources, no contacts,
        no experience. The difference is that some people, named as winners,
        choose to start it anyway. No matter what.<br /><br />
        How many meters you can run ? 200m, 400m, … etc. But I think you can run
        way more than that. More than what you have imagined till now. You
        haven’t enjoyed that success because you haven’t given it a try. Not
        only the race but this applies to every aspect of your life.<br /><br />
        Having courage to start is more important than succeeding because the
        people who consistently get started are the ones who can end up
        finishing anything. If can’t find anyone to support you, be bold and
        start anyway.<br /><br />
        You will be always there for yourself.<br /><br />
        I, me, myself. With that you will find supporters along the way.

        ><br /><br />
        We say it aloud, but deep inside we are lost. We know even one percent
        of it we can’t do. Because we have not given it a try. We were busy
        looking at others.<br /><br />
        Pause it for some days.<br /><br />
        Create new experiences. Try out the things that you once wished you
        would do. It is through the act of creating new experiences that we
        discover who we are and what is important to us.<br /><br />
        Once again focus – I, me & myself.<br /><br />
        Cook a meal instead of buying one. Play a game instead of watching one.
        Write a paragraph instead of reading one.<br /><br />
        Don’t just consume, create one.

        I whispered aloud in my heart. But brain got it. You know it is the CPU
        of your body.<br /><br />
        Did you take permission before doing it?<br /><br />
        Same goes with you.<br /><br />
        You don’t need permission to make yourself better. The typical standard
        doesn’t have to be your standard. You don’t need permission to love
        someone or something. If you love them, you just love them. If you love
        it, you just love it.<br /><br />
        You don’t need permission to create something you’re excited about, to
        quit your job & travel the world, to pursue a dream, to give up on a
        dream, or to do just about anything.<br /><br />
        If you want to do it, just do it. You don’t need to be tapped,
        appointed, chosen, or nominated to live a good life. You don’t need to
        be selected for greatness, just start living.<br /><br />
        It’s all about I, me & myself.
