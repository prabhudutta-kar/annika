          wanna become like …..”</i
        ><br /><br />
        Examples, Biographies, Stories etc…. we all need motivation to work on
        something. We all want to become like our idols. Possessing their ideas,
        thoughts, good deeds.<br /><br />
        Why not become the 1st you?<br /><br />
        <b>THE YOU!!!</b><br /><br />
        Do not wait for motivation. If you have goal, the most important thing
        is to start. If it’s not there, it will come once you give it a
        start.<br /><br />
        Then comes the “Excuses”.<br /><br />
        I have no money, no good factor, etc. But this not only happens with you.
        Most of us begin at the same place: no money, no resources, no contacts,
        no experience. The difference is that some people, named as winners,
        choose to start it anyway. No matter what.<br /><br />
        How many meters you can run ? 200m, 400m, … etc. But I think you can run
        way more than that. More than what you have imagined till now. You
        haven’t enjoyed that success because you haven’t given it a try. Not
        only the race but this applies to every aspect of your life.<br /><br />
        Having courage to start is more important than succeeding because the
        people who consistently get started are the ones who can end up
        finishing anything. If can’t find anyone to support you, be bold and
        start anyway.<br /><br />
        You will be always there for yourself.<br /><br />
        I, me, myself. With that you will find supporters along the way.

        We say it aloud, but deep inside we are lost. We know even one percent

        Pause it for some days.<br /><br />
        Create new experiences. Try out the things that you once wished you

        discover who we are and what is important to us.<br /><br />

        I whispered aloud in my heart. But brain got it. You know it is the CPU
        of your body.<br /><br />
        Did you take permission before doing it?<br /><br />
        Same goes with you.<br /><br />
        You don’t need permission to make yourself better. The typical standard
        doesn’t have to be your standard. You don’t need permission to love
        someone or something. If you love them, you just love them. If you love
        it, you just love it.<br /><br />
        You don’t need permission to create something you’re excited about, to
        quit your job & travel the world, to pursue a dream, to give up on a
        dream, or to do just about anything.<br /><br />
        If you want to do it, just do it. You don’t need to be tapped,
        appointed, chosen, or nominated to live a good life. You don’t need to
        be selected for greatness, just start living.<br /><br />
        It’s all about I, me & myself.

        <h4>I'M not consuming it anymore</h4>
        <img src="img/gallery/creativity.jpg" alt="" class="responsive-img" />
        1666, the most influential scientist in the history was strolling through a garden when he was stuck with a flash of
        creative brilliance that changed the world. <br><br>
        While standing under the shade of an apple tree, Sir Isaac Newton saw an apple fall to the ground.<i class=""> “why should that
        apple always fall descend perpendicularly to the ground,“</i> Newton wondered.<i class=""> “why should it not go sideways, or upwards
        but constantly to the Earth’s centre?</i><br><br>
        And thus, the concept of gravity was born.<br><br>
        The story of falling apple has become one of the lasting and iconic examples of the creative moment. It is a symbol of
        the inspired genius that fills your brain during those<i class=""> “Eureka moments”</i> when creative conditions are just right.<br>
        The falling apple was merely the beginning of train of thoughts that continued for decades. Newton isn’t the only one to
        wrestle with a great idea for years. Creative thinking is a process for all of us.<br><br>
        Creative thinking requires our brains to make connections between seemingly unrelated issues. A series is required to
        drive the creativity.<br>
        Being in the top 1% of intelligence has no correlation with being fantastically creative. Instead you simply have to be
        smart and then work hard, practice deliberately and put in your reps.<br>
        The growth of mindset is focussed more on the process than the outcome. This is the easy to accept in theory, but very
        hard to stick to in practice. Most of us don’t want to deal with the accompanying embarrassment or shame that is often
        required to learn the new skill.<br><br>
        Try upon the new things that come on your way. Just have faith and believe in yourself.

        <h4>No Credit, Share your Victories</h4>
        <img src="img/gallery/victory.jpg" alt="" class="responsive-img" />
        I think we all have worked in groups. What was it like?<br><br> Sometimes
        our ideas are not approved or sometimes our teammate just hop with
        a brilliant idea and at the end we end up with a J factor-jealousy. With
        this simple thought we just stop sharing. But it doesn’t work in any
        way. <br><br>
        Ideas that are hoarded help no one. To make your work matter,
        share it with someone. Team accomplishment is for better and
        greater than individual achievement.
        Giving is the greatest joy.<br><br>
        Pointing fingers, making claims or demanding recognition – a total
        nonsense.<br><br>
        Pretty much every idea you have ever had isn’t yours – you learnt
        from someone, you watched a video, you followed someone – it’s the
        result of something you read, something you were taught or
        something happened to you.<br><br>
        Then, Share your ideas. Share the victory with others. Enjoy with
        the cheers, smiles and laughs that brings down everyone together.
        Embrace the learning experience that is life and share the
        knowledge you stumble across freely.<br><br>
        Of course, there is always – I, me, and myself!<br><br>
        But success follows generosity.

        <h4>Complete or kill it</h4>
        <img src="img/gallery/kill.jpg" alt="" class="responsive-img" />
        Well, the other day I went through a topic about the ultimate act of self-denial and the route to
        enlightenment – a physical challenge known as <b>THE KAIHOGYO</b>. <br><br>
        KAIHOGYO- is a 1000-day challenge that takes place over seven years. If a monk chooses to undertake
        this challenge, this is what awaits him…<br><br>
        During year 1, the monk must run 30km per day for 100 straight days.<br>
        During year 2, the monk must again run 30 km per day for 100 straight days.<br>
        During year 3, the monk must once more run 30 km per day for 100 straight days.<br>
        During year 4, the monk must run 30 km per day. This time for 200 straight days.<br>
        During year 5, the monk must run 30 km per day for 200 straight days. After completing the 5th year
        of running, the monk must go 9 consecutive days without food, water or rest. Two monks stand
        beside him at all times to ensure that he doesn’t fall asleep.<br>
        During year 6, the monk must run 60 km per day for 100 straight days.<br>
        During year 7, the monk must run 84km per day for 100 straight days. And then, he must run 30 km
        per day for the final 1000 days.<br><br>
        But there is one final challenge that makes the kaihogyo unlike any other feet…<br>
        During the first 1000 days of running, the monk is allowed to withdraw from the kaihogyo. But from
        1001 day onwards, there is no withdrawal. The monk must either complete it or take his own life.
        Only 46 men have completed the challenge in last 400+ years and many others can be found by their
        unmarked graves.<br><br>
        The challenges that we all face in everyday life is somewhat similar to these. We all have that
        unfinished works that we leave it for days and then regret it after some time. What we all need is
        will power and determination to complete it. We don’t need those loose ends. Something that is
        important enough to us must be completed. <b>Time waits for none</b>. So, pause all unwanted stuffs that
        kill you and fill the life with goals that are worth finishing. Because a full determined work never goes
        in vain.<br>
